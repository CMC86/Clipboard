## My process

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow
Bootstrap - CSS framework


### What I learned
Working on this project allowed me to reinforce my understanding of responsive design and CSS positioning. I also learned more about using Bootstrap to quickly style and layout elements.

Here's an example of code Iâ€™m proud of:

<header class="text-center py-5 bg-light">
  <img src="images/logo.svg" alt="Logo" class="logo mb-4">
  <h1 class="display-4">A history of everything you copy</h1>
  <p class="lead text-muted">Clipboard allows you to track and organize everything you copy. Instantly access your clipboard on all your devices.</p>
  <div class="mt-4">
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-success btn-lg mr-2">Download for iOS</a>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Download for Mac</a>
  </div>
</header>


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to delve deeper into advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript to add more interactive elements and enhance user experience. I also aim to explore more modern frameworks like React.
### Useful resources

Bootstrap Documentation - This helped me to quickly prototype the layout and apply styles efficiently.
CSS Tricks - A great resource for learning and solving specific CSS issues.
